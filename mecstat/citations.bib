    abstract = {The one-dimensional Ising model with a transverse field is solved exactly by transforming the set of Pauli operators to a new set of Fermi operators. The elementary excitations, the ground-state energy and the free energy are found. The instantaneous correlation function between any two spins is calculated and this model shows a finite long-range order in the ground state when the transverse field is less than a critical value.}
