    abstract = { It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. },

    abstract = {The paramagnetic phase of the one-band Hubbard model is studied at zero-temperature, within the framework of dynamical mean-field theory, and for general particle-hole asymmetry where a doping-induced Mott transition occurs. Our primary focus is the Mott insulator (MI) phase, and our main aim to establish what can be shown exactly about it. To handle the locally doubly-degenerate MI requires two distinct self-energies, which reflect the broken symmetry nature of the phase and together determine the standard single self-energy. Exact results are obtained for the local charge, local magnetic moment and associated spin susceptibilities, the interaction-renormalised levels, and the low-energy behaviour of the self-energy in the MI phase. The metallic phase is also considered briefly, and shown to acquire an emergent particle-hole symmetry as the Mott transition is approached. Throughout the metal, Luttinger’s theorem is reflected in the vanishing of the Luttinger integral; for the generic MI by contrast this is shown to be non-vanishing, but again to have a universal magnitude. Numerical results are also obtained using NRG, for the metal/MI phase boundary, the scaling behaviour of the charge as the Mott transition is aproached from the metal, and associated universal scaling of single-particle dynamics as the low-energy Kondo scale vanishes.}

We calculate the density of states and the linear conductance focusing on their dependence on the chemical potential and on the temperature paying special attention to the Kondo and Coulomb blockade regimes for a large range of model parameters. We report that some standard approximations based on the EOM technique display a rather unexpected poor behavior in the Coulomb blockade regime even at high temperatures. Our study offers a critical comparison between the different methods as well as a detailed compilation of the shortcomings and limitations due the approximations involved in each technique, thus allowing for a cost-benefit analysis of the different solvers that considers both numerical precision and computational performance.}

    journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
    abstract = {We assess the reliability of the one-crossing approximation (OCA) approach in a quantitative description of the Mott transition in the framework of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The OCA approach has been applied in conjunction with DMFT to a number of heavy-fermion, actinide, transition metal compounds and nanoscale systems. However, several recent studies in the framework of impurity models pointed out serious deficiencies of OCA and raised questions regarding its reliability. Here we consider a single band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice at finite temperatures and compare the results of OCA to those of a numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The temperature-local repulsion U phase diagram for the particle-hole symmetric case obtained by OCA is in good agreement with that of QMC, with the metal–insulator transition captured very well. We find, however, that the insulator to metal transition is shifted to higher values of U and, simultaneously, correlations in the metallic phase are significantly overestimated. This counter-intuitive behaviour is due to simultaneous underestimations of the Kondo scale in the metallic phase and the size of the insulating gap. We trace the underestimation of the insulating gap to that of the second moment of the high-frequency expansion of the impurity spectral density. Calculations of the system away from the particle-hole symmetric case are also presented and discussed.}
